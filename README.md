# Jekyll Starter Project

This is my starter project for Jekyll. It is my ideal initial setup that I can use to kick
off other projects. It is not intended to be used without customization.

You may or may not find it useful depending on what your development preferences are. This
is not meant to be one-size fits all.

## Features

* Twitter Bootstrap 3
* Asset Pipelining
  * SASS
  * Coffee script
  * Minification
* Amazon S3 deploy and pre-optimized configuration
* Uses bundle for gems
* Sitemap
* RSS feed
* Rake tasks for common chores

### Roadmap

* Styles for common blog elements
* Favicon and mobile icons
* More SEO

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
2. `bundle`
3. `rake config`
4. Follow the on-screen instructions
5. `rake deploy`

You can also type `rake` and it will display a list of available tasks.
