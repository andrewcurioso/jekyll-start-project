# Jekyll Starter Project

This is my starter project for Jekyll. It is my ideal initial setup that I can use to kick off other projects. It is not intended to be used without customization.

You may or may not find it useful depending on what your development preferences are. This is not meant to be one-size fits all.

## Features

* Twitter Bootstrap 3
* Asset Pipelining
  * SASS
  * Coffee script
  * Minification
* Amazon S3 optimized configuration
* Uses bundle for gems

### Roadmap

* Rake tasks for common chores
* RSS feed
* Styles for common blog elements
* Favicon and mobile icons
* Sitemap and SEO

1. Clone the repo
2. `bundle`
3. `rake init` (todo)
4. Follow the on-screen instructions
5. `jekyll build`
