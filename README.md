# Jekyll Starter Project

My starter project for Jekyll. It has my ideal initial setup that I can use to kick off other projects.

You may or may not find it useful depending on what your development preferences are. This is not meant to be one-size fits all.

It includes the following:

* Twitter Bootstrap
* Asset Pipelining
* Amazon S3 optimized configuration
